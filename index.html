                    <H2>ABOUT</H2>
                    <p>My coding journey began in 2020 when I took my first 
                        programming class, Introduction to Computing. I was 
                        majoring in biology, so I took
                        that class with no real objective or intentions. As you
                        can imagine, I unexpectantly garnered a particular 
                        interest in the field.
                        <br>
                        From game development to web technologies, I thrive 
                        on exploring the boundaries of what's possible in the 
                        digital realm. Using technology and creativity to 
                        garner a greater understanding 
                        of the world and its interconnected system is something
                        I most look forward to navigating in this industry.
                        <br>
                        In my free time, I enjoy listening to music and watching
                        movies. I also enjoy crocheting, knitting, and painting.

                        <p>This project was for my capstone class. Myself and three
                            other students had the great opportunity to work with the 
                            Stanley A. Milner Edmonton Public Library and create a 
                            game that was to be displayed on their digital wall.
                            The game was designed primarily for kids, it's called Bug Snatch and the objective is to catch
                            and learn about bugs that are native to Alberta. <br><br>
                            The game was developed using the Unity Game Engine and has
                            touch responsive functionality. We used agile methodology to manage the 
                            project and foster efficient collaboration.

                        <p>This prototype was made for my Introduction to Computer
                            Games class. In this course, we learned how to create,
                            market, and design a game from start to end. We especially
                            focused on how to make an interesting interactive narrative
                            game. I learned about the thorough process of creating a
                            Game Design Document, as well as how to make a simple
                            2D pixel art RPG prototype that is Empire of Heroes.
                            I used the Unity Game Engine to create the prototype.

                        <p>This project is currently being developed for my 
                            Introduction to Real Time Gaming class. In this class, 
                        we are learning sprite animation, collision detection, 
                    and simple game artificial intelligence. By the end of the
                    semester, Hyperpop Groove Galaxy will be a 2.5D rhythm game in the Unity Game Engine
                that centers around the concepts of the underground nightclub scene. 
            Players will have to complete beatmaps to progress through various cities and 
        become the ultimate Raver.

                        <p>This project was made for my Introduction to File
                            and Database Management class. In the class, we 
                            learned about the entity-relationship model, the
                            relational model, SQL, and other relational query languages.

                            I worked in a group of 5 to develop an application using .NET
                            that simulated a car rental service. Cars were 
                            stored in an SQL database using mySQL and the rental 
                            service was contained in a Visual Studio GUI using C#.
                            The application deals with basic SQL table filtering 
                            though car colour, makes, years, etc. Users can 
                            filter by one parameter or multiple.
                            We also developed nested SQL queries that would do more complex filtering.

                            scheduling managers. Employees were stored in an 
                            SQL database. The application was developed in Java.
                            The application allows users to add, modify, delete,
                             and schedule employees.
                            We used Agile methodology to manage the project and foster efficient collaboration.</p>
